## Serenity SDK - Python

### Introduction

The Serenity digital asset risk platform exposes all functionality via an API -- currently REST only.

Although it's possible to call the API with simple HTTP client code in most any modern language, there
are conventions that need to be followed -- especially for authentication and authorization -- and to
make it easier we have provided this lightweight SDK.

### Installation

Installation for Python 3.x users is very simple using pip:

```plain
pip install serenity.sdk.python
```

### Maintainer setup

If you are checking in code for ```serenity.sdk.python``` you may wish to run ```setup.sh``` to install
appropriate pre-commit and pre-push git hooks in your local repo. Once you run setup you will also
get a Python virtual environment in ```.venv``` generated by Poetry; if using VSCode, you should select
this as your IDE's virtual environment.

### Learning more

At this time the API and its documentation are only available to members of our private beta, via
their personal Serenity Developer Portal, e.g. https://developer.$client.cloudwall.network.
